            <p class="text-gray-600">Both 5-Card Stud and 7-Card Stud are classic poker variants where players build their best hand from a combination of face-down "hole cards" and face-up "door cards" dealt over several rounds, with betting after each new card. The primary difference lies in the total number of cards dealt to each player (five vs. seven) and how many are hidden versus revealed. The goal remains the same: to form the best five-card poker hand.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600">Poker is a card game where players bet against each other on the strength of their hand, which is typically made up of five cards. The goal is to have the best hand at the end of the betting rounds, or to bluff your opponents into folding their hands.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">Key elements include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mt-2">
                <li><strong>The Deck:</strong> Played with a standard 52-card deck.</li>
                <li><strong>Card Ranks:</strong> Cards rank from Ace (highest) down to 2 (lowest). An Ace can also be used as a low card in some straights (e.g., A-2-3-4-5).</li>
                <li><strong>Suits:</strong> Spades (♠), Hearts (♥), Diamonds (♦), and Clubs (♣). Suits generally have no ranking in most poker games.</li>
                <li><strong>Betting:</strong> Players wager chips into a central "pot." The player with the best hand at the "showdown" wins the pot.</li>
                <li><strong>Folding:</strong> To give up your hand and any chips already bet, exiting the current round.</li>
                <li><strong>Calling:</strong> To match the current bet.</li>
                <li><strong>Raising:</strong> To increase the current bet.</li>
                <li><strong>All-In:</strong> When a player bets all their remaining chips. They can only win the portion of the pot corresponding to their own bet.</li>
                <li><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Betting strongly with a weak hand to encourage opponents to fold.</li>
            </ul>
